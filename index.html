<h1>An American Workpla(y)ce</h1>

<p>"An American Workpla(y)ce" is a theater adaptation of "The Office" (U.S) from the filmmaker behind "The Arrow Fish's Heart"! See everyone's favorite branch of Dunder Mifflin in a whole new light! With some minor modernizations, fresh additions, and new jokes, This adaptation will keep the spirit of the U.S show whilst also managing to feel unique and fresh, with a small bit of familiarity at the same time. You'll never look at paper quite the same ever again.</p>

<p2005>The People of An American Workpla(y)ce</p2005>

<p></p>

<p2004>Michael Gary Scott - The world's best boss! 
 This dimwit is known for somehow managing, always beating the odds (even if it is just by taking credit for other people's actions), and having an immaculate sense of humor. Despite his childish antics, He always manages to get the job done at any cost. Any. Cost. If you don't like people, then Michael will either reinforce that or change that entirely! </p2004>

<p></p>

 <p2004>Dwight Kurt Shrute III - Everyone's favorite beet farmer! This unique individual is known for his intense fashion sense and crazy womanizing abilities. He'll attempt to sell you [on] just about anything as long as it means you don't ever buy anything from his arch nemesis. Yes, That even includes himself. </p2004>
<p></p>

 <p2004>Jim Halpert - Dwight's arch nemesis. This everybody salesman who can charm anyone into buying paper is the ultimate prankster. You need to pull a prank on someone? He'll do it. But lately, he's been focusing his efforts on a little Dwight Shrute, and nobody's stopping him. Some go with his antics (such as the receptionists), but others oppose them (Michael [and obviously Dwight]). It's the battle of the wits as the two titan salesmen battle it out! Who will get the last laugh?</p2004>
 <p></p>
 <p2004>Pam Beesly - For some, She's a ray of sunshine in the otherwise grim office. For others, She's just the young woman engaged to one of the Warehouse workers and nothing more. Alas, There's not a single person out there who truly dislikes this receptionist extraordinare. She's dorky, and very talkative. She's on Jim's side of the battle between him and Dwight, and assists him on his journey every chance she's given. She'll win you over whether you like it or not.</p2004>
 <p></p>
 <p2004>Ryan Howard - Michael's man-crush in the office. This temp for Dunder Mifflin Scranton goes to great lengths to avoid the horrors of The Office. From actively trying to ignore Michael to getting caught in a little business fraud, This audience surrogate certainly will leave an impression. You'll never quite forget Ryan Howard, even if you try really hard to. </p2004>
<p></p>
<p2004>Toby Flenderson - Michael's sworn enemy. The introverted HR rep hired by Corporate. Everyone loves a good Corpo or two. Michael does not, however. Michael feels Toby isn't quite part of "The Office" family due to the fact he was hired by Corporate as Corporate employee. Whether or not his hatred for him is valid will depend solely on the first impression you get from Toby, and guess what? First impressions... They're key, huh?</p2004>
