<p2005>The People of An American Workpla(y)ce</p2005>

<p></p>

<p2004>Michael Gary Scott - The world's best boss! 
 This dimwit is known for somehow managing, always beating the odds (even if it is just by taking credit for other people's actions), and having an immaculate sense of humor. Despite his childish antics, He always manages to get the job done at any cost. Any. Cost. If you don't like people, then Michael will most likely reinforce that entirely! </p2004>

<p></p>

 <p2004>Dwight Kurt Shrute III - Everyone's favorite beet farmer! This unique individual is known for his intense fashion sense and shockingly great womanizing abilities. He'll attempt to sell you [on] just about anything including himself as long as it means you don't ever buy anything from his arch nemesis. Don't doubt him, He'll sell you on something else if you even bother doubting him! Just don't expect him to charm you up. If there's one thing Dwight isn't, it's charming. Unless you find the unexpected charming. In that case? Expect the unexpected. </p2004>
<p></p>

 <p2004>James "Jim" Halpert - Dwight's arch nemesis. This everybody salesman who can charm anyone into buying paper is the ultimate prankster. You need to pull a prank on someone? He'll do it. But lately, he's been focusing his efforts on a little Dwight Shrute, and nobody's stopping him. Some go with his antics (such as the receptionists), but others oppose them (Michael [and obviously Dwight]). It's the battle of the wits as the two titan salesmen battle it out! Who will get the last laugh?</p2004>
 <p></p>
 <p2004>Pamela Morgan Beesly - For some, She's a ray of sunshine in the otherwise grim office. For others, She's just the young woman engaged to one of the Warehouse workers and nothing more. Alas, There's not a single person out there who truly dislikes this receptionist extraordinare. She's dorky, and very talkative. She's on Jim's side of the battle between him and Dwight, and assists him on his journey every chance she's given. She'll win you over whether you like it or not.</p2004>
 <p></p>
 <p2004>Ryan Howard - Michael's man-crush in the office. This temp for Dunder Mifflin Scranton goes to great lengths to avoid the horrors of The Office. From actively trying to ignore Michael to getting caught in a little business fraud, This audience surrogate certainly will leave an impression. You'll never quite forget Ryan Howard, even if you try really hard to. </p2004>
<p></p>
<p2004>Toby Flenderson - Michael's sworn enemy. The introverted HR rep hired by Corporate. Everyone loves a good Corpo or two. Michael does not, however. Michael feels Toby isn't quite part of "The Office" family due to the fact he was hired by Corporate as Corporate employee. Whether or not his hatred for him is valid will depend solely on the first impression you get from Toby, and guess what? First impressions... They're key, huh?</p2004>
<p></p>
<p2004>Jan Levinson - Michael's direct supervisor. She is the target of several of Michael's advances. From questions relating to the past to bringing up her divorce seemingly at random, Jan can never catch a break from him. The real question is, Does she even want to catch one? As relationships and love blossoms around Michael and Jan, Will they sucumb to the blossoms of love too, or will Jan make sure they resist the blossosm at all costs? </p2004>
<p></p>
<p2004>Katy Moore - A handbag saleswoman whose destiny brings her to Dunder Mifflin Scranton. From standing up for Pam when no-one else will to falling in love with Jim, Her world is forever shaken by Dunder Mifflin Scranton. She might not be the sharpest tool in the shed, but she tries time and time again to make the world around her work. You'll find her either extremely annoying or very likable. Either way, She'll never quite leave ya. Will her destiny ever exit Dunder Miffin Scranton's grasp or is there a reason they have such a tight grasp on her destiny?</p2004>
<p></p>
<p2004> Roy Anderson - A warehouse worker with a vengeance. This meant-to-be-football-player seemed to settled for not that alongside his fianc√©e Pam Beesly. He might not know the most things that can be known, but that isn't to say he's careless. From making a not-so-right statement about Katy to making split-second choices that'll forever impact some of the lives around him, He's not an incapable oaf. Alas, Whether he's much more than not one will all depend on you and your views of what makes a good man.</p2004>
<p></p>
<p2005>The Managers of An American Workpla(y)ce</p2005>
<p></p>
<p2004>L. Cross - Part Hufflepuff, part Cyberpunk. This ambitious "The Office" (U.S) fanboy is the writer behind the play and is most known for his unique writing style. He is also the director and writer behind the animated film "The Arrow Fish's Heart", and the upcoming psychological thriller film "Seven Perfect Days" and comedy film "Odgen's Nut Gone Flake"! He also reviews films in his spare time on "Letterboxd", and is currently in the midst of a Disney Channel Original Movie binge. If there's one man who can write a theatrical play that isn't a musical parody based off "The Office" (U.S), it's this one.</p2004>
<p></p>
<p2004>Tobly & Bob McSmith - The authors of "The Office! A Musical Parody". While the two have nothing to do with An American Workpla(y)ce (fun fact: and the writer didn't even know that the musical existed until halfway through writing the second act[!]), They were the pioneers of bringing this wonderful show to a medium other than television. For that, They deserve a lot of credit. An American Workpla(y)ce wouldn't be the same without these two, and they deserve a special mention for daring to bring.</p2004>
